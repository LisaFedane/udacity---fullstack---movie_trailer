# udacity---fullstack---movie_trailer
Project 1 from Udacity Fullstack Web Developer Nanodegree course

This program is to display my favorite movies and show: 
1. A Poster image
2. The Title 
3. A brief summary 
3. Show the movie trailer

This is written in Python 2.7.11

The program will launch a webbrowser page and exhibits movie poster tiles with the title 
and summary beneath the art.  

You should be able to click on the art to launch and view the youtube trailer

## Getting Started

In order to run the program you will need to download 3 .py files into the same file: 

1. media.py
2. fresh_tomatoes.py
3. entertainment_center.py

The first two files are resources for the entertainment_center.py file 

Open the entertainment_center.py file in idle running 
2.7.11 and run it
