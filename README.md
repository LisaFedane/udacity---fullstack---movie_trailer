# udacity---fullstack---movie_trailer
Project 1 from Udacity Fullstack Web Developer Nanodegree course

This program is to display my favorite movies by showing the following: 
1. A Poster Image
2. The Title 
3. A Brief Summary 
3. Launch a Movie Trailer

This is written in Python 2.7.11

The program will launch a webbrowser page that exhibits: movie poster tiles with the movie title 
and movie summary beneath the poster.  

You will be able to click on the poster to launch and view the youtube trailer

## Getting Started

In order to run the program you will need to download three seperate .py files into the same file: 

1. media.py
2. fresh_tomatoes.py
3. entertainment_center.py

The first two files are resources for the entertainment_center.py file draw on

Open the entertainment_center.py file in idle running 
2.7.11 and run the code

### Full Disclousure

This code is written while following Udacity's course and is their code rewritten by me to individualize my project.  
The fresh_tomoatoes code is downloaded from Udacity with some minor changes made by me
